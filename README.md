# node-sparkbot

Yet [another opiniated framework](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/awesome-ciscospark#bot-frameworks) to quickly build [Cisco Spark Bots](https://developer.ciscospark.com/bots.html) in nodejs:
- with a simple design to help you learn and experiment Spark webhooks concepts in a snatch,
- and flexible enough to let your bot listen to raw webhook events, or directly respond to commands,  
- leveraged by a few DevNet learning labs, and bot samples. 

This project focusses on the [framework itself](#architecture) and its [testing companions](./tests/README.md).

If you're looking for ready-to-run Cisco Spark bots built with the library, jump to the [node-sparkbot-samples repo](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/node-sparkbot-samples).


## Quickstart

Copy a sample from [Quickstart](quickstart/).

For **Mac, Linux and bash users**, open a terminal and type:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/node-sparkbot
cd node-sparkbot
npm install
DEBUG=sparkbot* node tests/onEvent-all-all.js
```

For **Windows users**, open a command shell and type:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/node-sparkbot
cd node-sparkbot
npm install
set DEBUG=sparkbot*
node tests/onEvent-all-all.js
```

**Done, your bot is live**

Let's check it's live by hittinh its healthcheck endpoint:

```
# simply run: curl http://localhost:8080 
# or if you like formatting, install jq and run:
$ curl http://localhost:8080 | jq -C
{
  "message": "Congrats, your Cisco Spark webhook is up and running",
  "since": "2016-09-23T07:46:52.397Z",
  "tip": "Register your bot as a WebHook to start receiving events: https://developer.ciscospark.com/endpoint-webhooks-post.html",
  "listeners": [
    "messages/created"
  ],
  "token": false,
  "account": {},
  "interpreter": {},
  "commands": [],
}
```

**Congrats, your bot is now up and running**

Let's have Spark post us events :
- if your bot is running on a local machine, you need to [expose your bot to the internet](docs/SettingUpYourSparkBot.md#expose-you-bot).
- and last, [register your bot by creating a Spark Webhook](docs/SettingUpYourSparkBot.md#register-your-bot-as-a-spark-webhook).

Note that if you want your bot to respond to commands, add a Spark API token on the command line (see below).

Finally, we suggest you take a look at the [tests](tests/README.md) as they provide a great way to discover the framework features.


### Respond to commands

At startup, the library looks for a SPARK_TOKEN environment variable.
If present, the library will leverage the token to retreive new message contents, and automatically detect the Spark account associated to the token and take initialization options to fit common scenarios, see [Account detection](#account-type-detection).

As messages flow in, the library automatically removes bot mentions when relevant, so that you can focus on the command itself.

```shell
DEBUG=sparkbot*  SPARK_TOKEN=MY_VERY_SECRET_ACCESS_TOKEN   node tests/onCommand.js

...
  sparkbot webhook instantiated with default configuration +0ms
  sparkbot addMessagesCreatedListener: listener registered +89ms
  sparkbot Cisco Spark bot started on port: 8080 +8ms
  sparkbot:interpreter bot account detected, name: CiscoDevNet (bot) +1s
```


## Architecture

The library supports the full set of Cisco Spark webhooks, see https://developer.ciscospark.com/webhooks-explained.html

As Spark fires Webhook events, the related listener functions are called.

You can register to listen to a WebHook event by calling the function **".on(<resources>,<event>)"**

Note that the library implements a shortcut that lets you listen to all Webhook events. Check sample code [onEvent-all-all.js](tests/onEvent-all-all.js).

```javascript
var SparkBot = require("sparkbot");
var bot = new SparkBot();
 
bot.onEvent("all", "all", function(trigger) {
  
    // YOUR CODE HERE
    console.log("EVENT: " + trigger.resource + "/" + trigger.event + ", with data id: " + trigger.data.id + ", triggered by person id:" + trigger.actorId);
});
```

This other example code [onEvent-messages-created.js](tests/onEvent-messages-created.js) illustrates how to listen to (Messages/Created) Webhook events.

```javascript
// Starts your Webhook with default configuration where the SPARK API access token is read from the SPARK_TOKEN env variable 
var SparkBot = require("sparkbot");
var bot = new SparkBot();

bot.onEvent("messages", "created", function(trigger) {
    console.log("new message from: " + trigger.data.personEmail + ", in room: " + trigger.data.roomId);
    bot.decryptMessage(trigger, function (err, message) {
        if (err) {
            console.log("could not fetch message contents, err: " + err.message); 
            return;
        }

        // YOUR CODE HERE
        console.log("processing message contents: " + message.text);
    });
});
```


### New message listener

The library also provides a shortcut easy way to listen to only new messages, via the .onMessage() function.

Note that this function is not only a shorcut to create a **".on('messages', 'created')"** listener.
It also automatically fetches for you the text of the new message by requesting Spark for the message details.
As the message is fetched behind the scene, you should position a SPARK_TOKEN env variable when starting up your bot.

Check the [onMessage.js](tests/onMessage.js) for an example:

```javascript
// Starts your Webhook with default configuration where the SPARK API access token is read from the SPARK_TOKEN env variable 
SparkBot = require("node-sparkbot");
var bot = new SparkBot();
 
bot.onMessage(function(trigger, message) {
 
  // ADD YOUR CUSTOM CODE HERE
  console.log("new message from: " + trigger.data.personEmail + ", text: " + message.text);
});
```

Note that most of the time, you'll want to check for the presence of a keyword to take action.
To that purpose, you can check this example: [onMessage-asCommand](tests/onMessage-asCommand.js).

```javascript
// Starts your Webhook with default configuration where the SPARK API access token is read from the SPARK_TOKEN env variable 
var SparkBot = require("node-sparkbot");
var bot = new SparkBot();

bot.onMessage(function (trigger, message) {
    console.log("new message from: " + trigger.data.personEmail + ", text: " + message.text);

    var command = bot.asCommand(message);
    if (command) {
        // // ADD YOUR CUSTOM CODE HERE
        console.log("detected command: " + command.keyword + ", with args: " + JSON.stringify(command.args));
    }
});
```

_Note that The onCommand function below is pretty powerful, as it not only checks for command keywords, but also removes any mention of your bot, as this mention is a Spark pre-requisite for your bot to receive a message in a group room,
but it meaningless for your bot to process the message._

Well that said, we're ready to go thru the creation of interactive assistants.


### Interactive assistants

- respond to commands (keywords) via an .onCommand() listener function
- option to trim mention if your bot is mentionned in a group room
- option to specify a fallback command
- check [onCommand](tests/onCommand.js) sample


### Healthcheck

The library automatically exposes an healthcheck endpoint.
As such, hitting GET / will respond a 200 OK with an attached JSON payload.

The healcheck JSON payload will give you extra details: 
- token:true  // if a Spark token was detected at launch
- account     // detailled info about the spark account attached to the token
- listeners   // events for which your bot has registered a listener
- commands    // commands for which your bot is ready to be activated
- interpreter // preferences for the command interpreter

   
```json
// Example of a JSON healthcheck
{
  "message": "Congrats, your Cisco Spark Bot is up and running",
  "since": "2016-09-01T13:15:39.425Z",

    "prefix": "/",
    "trimMention": true,
    "ignoreSelf": false
  },
  "commands": [
    "help"
  ]
}
``` 


### Account Type Detection

If a Cisco Spark API access token has been specified at launch, the library will request details about the Spark account.
From the person details provided, the library will infer if the token matches a individual (HUMAN) or a bot account (MACHINE).
Because of restrictions concerning bots, the library will setup a default behavior from the account type, unless configuration parameters have already been provided at startup.

_Note that the automatic account detection procedure is done asynchronously at launch._

Here is the set of extra information and behaviors that relate to the automatic bot detection:
    - your bot is populated with an account property
    - your bot is added a nickName property
    - a type is attached to your bot instance [HUMAN | MACHINE | OTHER]


### Authenticating Requests via payload signature 

To ensure paylods received by your bots come from Cisco Spark, you can supply a secret parameter at Webhook creation.
Every payload posted to your bot will then contain an extra HTTP header "X-Spark-Signature" containing an HMAC-SHA1 signature of the payload.

Once you've created the webhook for your bot with a secret parameter, 
you can either specify a SECRET environment variable on the command line or in your code.

Command line example:
```shell
DEBUG=sparkbot*  SPARK_TOKEN=your_bot_token WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_secret   node tests/onEvent-check-secret.js
...
```

Code example:
```javascript
// Starts your Webhook with default configuration where the SPARK API access token is read from the SPARK_TOKEN env variable 
SparkBot = require("node-sparkbot");
var bot = new SparkBot();
bot.secret = "not THAT secret"
...
```

Note that it is a HIGHLY RECOMMENDED however not mandatory security practice to set up a SECRET. 
If your bot has been started with a secret, then the processing will abort if the incoming payload signature is not present or do not fit.
However, the bot framework defines a flag so that you can ignore signature check failures when a SECRET is defined.


### Auto-Register Webhooks

At startup, node-sparkbot can automatically create a Webhook for your bot, or verify if a webhook already exists with the specified name.

Check [onCommand-register.js](tests/onCommand-register.js) for an example.

```javascript
bot.createOrUpdateWebhook("register-bot", "https://f6d5d937.ngrok.io", "all", "all", null, bot.secret, function (err, webhook) {
  console.log("webhook successfully created, id: " + webhook.id);
});
```


### Minimal footprint

node-sparkbot makes a minimal use of third party libraries :
- debug: as we need a customizable logger
- express & body-parser: as its Web API foundation
- htmlparser2: to filter out the bot mention from the message contents

Morever, node-sparkbot does not embedd a Cisco Spark client SDK, 
so that you can choose your favorite (ie, among ciscospark, node-sparky or node-sparclient...).
