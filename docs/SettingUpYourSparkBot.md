# How to setup your Webex Teams bot

This guide details how to have your local bot (ie, running on a dev machine or a private network), talk to the Webex cloud platform.

1. Start you bot
2. Check your bot is healthy 
3. Expose your bot 
4. Create a Spark Webhook 


## Start you bot

**Skip this (if you have already started your bot)**

Here are the steps to install this project samples and run them

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies
3. Run an example from the tests 

``` bash
# Clone repo
> git clone https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/node-sparkbot
# Install dependencies 
> cd sparkbot-webhook-samples
> npm install
# Run an example
> DEBUG=sparkbot*,samples* node tests/onEvent-all-all.js
...
bot started at http://localhost:8080/
   GET  / for health checks
   POST / receives Webex webhook events
```

## Check your bot is healthy

Hit localhost to check your bot is running, either via [your Web browser](http://localhost:8080) or via CURL (see below)
You should get back an JSON payload with your bot properties.

``` bash
# Ping your bot
> curl http://localhost:8080
...
{
  "message": "Congrats, your webhook is up and running",
  "since": "2016-09-01T13:15:39.425Z",
  "listeners": [
    ...
```


## Expose you bot 

To expose your boot on the internet, we'll leverage a tunnelling tool. 
You may pick any tool, the steps below leverage localtunnel. 

There you need to choose a unique subdomain name, which localtunnel will use to create your bot public internel URL.

Replace **<yourbot>** in the following steps by your bot subdomain name.

Note : make sure you hit your bot **secured** HTTPS endpoint. 


``` bash
# Install local tunnel
> npm install localtunnel -g
# Create the tunnel
> lt -s <yourbot> -p 8080
your url is: http://<yourbot>.localtunnel.me

# In another terminal, check your bot is accessible
> curl https://<yourbot>.localtunnel.me/

}
```


## Register your bot with a WebHook

Last step, is to create a Webex Teams Webhook for your bot.

This can be done via the Webex  Developer Portal / [Create a WebHook](https://developer.webex.com/endpoint-webhooks-post.html) interactive documentation,
but also via Postman or a CURL command as will see right after.

### via the interactive documentation

For the scope of this example, we'll associate our bot to all resources and events.

Note: even if our webhook can process all events, you can register a webhook with a more limited set of events. Then Webex will then invoke your webhook only if those events happen (whatever your bot can process).

### via CURL

As an alternative, you can run this CURL command.

``` bash
> curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_BOT_TOKEN" -d '{
        "name": "Bot Sample",
        "resource": "all",
        "event": "all",
        "targetUrl": "https://yourbot.localtunnel.me/"
    }' "https://api.ciscospark.com/v1/webhooks/"
```


### via postman

Or you can also create this webhook via Postman.
