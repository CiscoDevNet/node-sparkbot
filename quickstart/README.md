# Quickstart

If you're looking for **end-to-end bot use-cases**, go straight to the [node-sparkbot-samples](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/node-sparkbot-samples).

To start with the framework, start from the `onEvent-all-all.js` example to run some code that listens to Cisco Spark notifications,
and add a [Cisco Spark Webhook](https://developer.ciscospark.com/webhooks-explained.html) to start receiving notifications.

Check the instructions on the [main project page](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/node-sparkbot/tree/master/#quickstart) to run the code on your local machine.
